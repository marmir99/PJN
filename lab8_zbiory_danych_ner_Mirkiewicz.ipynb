Technology comes through again!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nThunder Force (2021): \\'80s Month started out in a state of\\r\\ninterruption thanks to this Netflix original that, I assume, missed\\r\\nits theatrical chance thanks to the pandemic. Superhero origin stories\\r\\nare very 21st-century, but this is a \"wacky science\" story, so at\\r\\nleast it has an \\'80s heart. And an \\'80s soundtrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone\\'s game for the comedy, Jason Bateman is delightfully\\r\\ntypecast, and there were a couple of real funny scenes, so it\\'s far\\r\\nfrom the worst movie we saw in April. It\\'s a huge idiot plot,\\r\\nthough. I literally realized a huge problem while opening the fridge,\\r\\nand from that point on enjoyed the movie less.\\r\\n\\r\\nHanky Panky (1982): This was the worst movie we saw\\r\\nin April. Best thing I can say about Hanky Panky is, we see\\r\\nsome classic slices-of-life due to Sidney Poitier\\'s insistence on\\r\\nlocation shoots for scenes that could easily have been done on the\\r\\nbacklot. There\\'s a New York coffee shop called \"Disco Donut\"!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nOtherwise, this feels like a movie destined for heavy Comedy\\r\\nCentral rotation in the \\'90s: three good slapstick gags, comedians who aren\\'t\\r\\nsuper funny on their own and have no chemistry together, reliance on\\r\\naction-y set pieces, and an overall rejection of both jokes and\\r\\ncharacter comedy in favor of a vague morass I call \"lighthearted\\r\\ndrama\".\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading Places (1983): An excellent film all around except for an\\r\\nill-conceived, monumentally lowbrow section on a\\r\\ntrain; a section which can easily be cut for television because it has\\r\\nno effect on the otherwise superb plot. You can draw a straight line\\r\\nbetween the pre-train scene and the post-train scene, predict its\\r\\nexistence without seeing it, and be better off.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from that, really funny overall. Nobody does \"smart but not\\r\\nas smart as he thinks he is\" like Dan Aykroyd. I also enjoyed\\r\\nimagining the Duke brothers as being played by Statler and Waldorf.\\r\\n\\r\\nFootloose (1984): We were expecting a superficial feel-good\\r\\nfilm, especially as scenery-chewing John Lithgow was revealed as the villain, but it\\'s\\r\\nactually pretty subtle. Lithgow\\'s performance has some depth, he\\'s by far the\\r\\nbest actor in the film and his character garners some sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack for this movie is something else, I tell you. \"Let\\'s\\r\\nHear It for the Boy\" and \"Holding Out for a Hero\" were both originally\\r\\nreleased on the Footloose soundtrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Color Purple (1985): A well-done rural\\r\\ndrama, generally depressing but with moments of triumph at the most  Speilbergian moments. Whoopi Goldberg in particular is great in this. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was expecting a good dose of horror in The Color Purple, but I didn\\'t expect the most\\r\\nhorrifying thing in the film to be the clueless comic-relief white\\r\\nlady. She\\'s a tonal mismatch with the rest of the movie, and Spielberg\\r\\nadmits he was out of his depth directing this thing, but I tell you,\\r\\nSumana and I were on the edge of our seats like Miss Millie was the\\r\\nJurassic Park T-Rex.\\r\\n\\r\\nRuthless People (1986): The prize of \\'80s Month! A tightly\\r\\nwritten, extremely fun character-driven comedy. A little convoluted\\r\\nbut not too hard to follow. And—this one\\'s just for\\r\\nLeonard—packed chock full of outrageous \\'80s L.A. design, with its\\r\\nbright-colored triangles and impractical furniture shapes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOutrageous Fortune (1987): This is basically the good\\r\\nversion of Hanky Panky. The main characters are really fun, \\r\\nwith great dialogue, neurotic in different ways. (Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner were effectively playing gender-swapped versions of each other.) But it\\'s got Hanky Panky\\'s overreliance on action scenes and even the same road-trip from NYC to the Southwest (was\\r\\nthere a tax credit?). I greatly preferred the first part of the film\\r\\nwhere the main characters were just being obnoxious to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing to America (1988): A fun, wholesome romcom of the\\r\\ntype I do not associate with Eddie Murphy\\'s comedy style, but it\\r\\nworks. John Amos is particularly funny as the uptight entrpreneurial\\r\\ndad; is it too much to hope that in the 2021 sequel he\\'s revealed to\\r\\nhave a Gus Fring side? Recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to IMDB trivia, \"According to John Landis, it was his\\r\\nidea to have Eddie Murphy wear make-up to play a Jewish man, as a sort\\r\\nof payback for Jewish comedians wearing blackface in the early 1900s.\"\\r\\nYeah, the early 1900s, how time flies, it\\'s been five whole\\r\\nyears since John Landis directed a scene between Eddie Murphy and\\r\\na corked-up Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places. I guess this was\\r\\nhis way of apologizing, and this was far from the worst thing Landis\\r\\nhas done while making a movie (look it up; I won\\'t mention the name of\\r\\na crime because he was acquitted, but even without the criminal aspect he was responsible for a workplace where people died).\\r\\n\\r\\nBatman (1989): It had to be this to close out the decade; the film that all the boys in my grade were obsessed with for months and I never saw because who drives to Bakersfield and sees movies? Not my family, apparently.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard to believe that at the time this was\\r\\nthe \"dark\" version. With Nolan for comparison this is a bunch of goofy\\r\\nTim Burton stuff, effectively a gritty reboot of Pee-Wee\\'s Big\\r\\nAdventure. Burton doesn\\'t spend too much time in the ball pit and the result\\r\\nis a fun movie overall. There are a couple characters who are\\r\\nsuperfluous to the screenplay, but judging from the voluminous IMDB\\r\\ntrivia this thing was undergoing serious rewrites as it was being\\r\\nshot, so you\\'ll get loose ends.\\r\\n\\r\\nJack Nicholson\\'s a great Joker—by far the best thing about\\r\\nthis movie—but/and his Joker laugh is this Jack Lemmon-esque\\r\\nbark which distracted me with a million-dollar realization: Jack\\r\\nLemmon would have been incredible as an interim Joker in the\\r\\n1970s. Throw in Walter Matthau as a dad-joke Riddler and you\\'ve got\\r\\ngood stuff, hypothetically speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nI watched a bit of Cesar Romero\\'s Joker while writing this review, and\\r\\nlearned about a proto-Harley Quinn named Queenie. The Joker\\'s\\r\\nalso got a proto-Harley moll in this movie, though she\\'s one of those superfluous characters I mentioned earlier and has little to do. It\\'s incredible how close to the surface Harley Quinn was for so long without taking a coherent form.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, from my perspective in 2021 I really loved how this movie\\r\\ndoesn\\'t really care about Batman\\'s origins. It assumes you already\\r\\nknow about Batman. After all... he\\'s Batman. If you somehow went in to\\r\\nthis film not knowing that Batman and Bruce Wayne were the same guy,\\r\\nthere\\'s no \"reveal\", just an inexplicable scene 3/4 of the way through\\r\\nwhere Michael Keaton\\'s in the Batcave for some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n ', 'Everyone\\'s game for the comedy, Jason Bateman is delightfully\\r\\ntypecast, and there were a couple of real funny scenes, so it\\'s far\\r\\nfrom the worst movie we saw in April.

If you somehow went in to\\r\\nthis film not knowing that Batman and Bruce Wayne were the same guy,\\r\\nthere\\'s no \"reveal\", just an inexplicable scene 3/4 of the way through\\r\\nwhere Michael Keaton\\'s in the Batcave for some reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n', 'Apart from that, really funny overall. Nobody does \"smart but not\\r\\nas smart as he thinks he is\" like Dan Aykroyd. I also enjoyed\\r\\nimagining the Duke brothers as being played by Statler and Waldorf.\\r\\n\\r\\nFootloose (1984): We were expecting a superficial feel-good\\r\\nfilm, especially as scenery-chewing John Lithgow was revealed as the villain, but it\\'s\\r\\nactually pretty subtle. Lithgow\\'s performance has some depth, he\\'s by far the\\r\\nbest actor in the film and his character garners some sympathy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soundtrack for this movie is something else, I tell you. \"Let\\'s\\r\\nHear It for the Boy\" and \"Holding Out for a Hero\" were both originally\\r\\nreleased on the Footloose soundtrack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Color Purple (1985): A well-done rural\\r\\ndrama, generally depressing but with moments of triumph at the most  Speilbergian moments. Whoopi Goldberg in particular is great in this. \\r\\n\\r\\nI was expecting a good dose of horror in The Color Purple, but I didn\\'t expect the most\\r\\nhorrifying thing in the film to be the clueless comic-relief white\\r\\nlady.

A tightly\\r\\nwritten, extremely fun character-driven comedy. A little convoluted\\r\\nbut not too hard to follow. And—this one\\'s just for\\r\\nLeonard—packed chock full of outrageous \\'80s L.A. design, with its\\r\\nbright-colored triangles and impractical furniture shapes. \\r\\n\\r\\nOutrageous Fortune (1987): This is basically the good\\r\\nversion of Hanky Panky. The main characters are really fun, \\r\\nwith great dialogue, neurotic in different ways. (Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner were effectively playing gender-swapped versions of each other.) But it\\'s got Hanky Panky\\'s overreliance on action scenes and even the same road-trip from NYC to the Southwest (was\\r\\nthere a tax credit?). I greatly preferred the first part of the film\\r\\nwhere the main characters were just being obnoxious to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing to America (1988): A fun, wholesome romcom of the\\r\\ntype I do not associate with Eddie Murphy\\'s comedy style, but it\\r\\nworks.

I guess this means the golden age of blockbusters continues!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nPrivate Benjamin (1980): One of those unassuming gems that hides in cinema history waiting to pounce on people doing these constrained watching exercises. This is a series of comedy sketches that combine to form a plot that ranges far and wide, extending both before and after the boot-camp sequence we were expecting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never heard of Private Benjamin before \\'80s Month, but it was a deserved hit and started a mini-fad. Turns out that Stripes (1981) is a Private Benjamin copycat: what if men joined the Army? Between this and Nine To Five I feel like 1980 was the high water mark of a Women\\'s Lib trend in women-led comedies that receded until the 2010s.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoophole (1981): The only big 1981 film that appealed was Time Bandits, which I couldn\\'t find as a rental. So we rolled the dice on a British heist movie, and those usually reliable dice came up \"rather\" and \"disappointing\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s always fun when a square with professional qualifications (here Martin Sheen as an architect) gets roped into a heist, but this is ultimately a feature-length dramatization of the \"one chalk mark\" joke. And the \"loophole\" isn\\'t a loophole at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSumana zeroed in on the potential: Loophole feels like a war movie, showing the camaraderie of men from different backgrounds isolated from their families, looking out for each other and working towards a common goal. In addition, there is a very exciting climax which would be the ideal place for a double-cross or heist-within-the-heist, maybe employing (just spitballing here) an actual loophole in something. But we just cut away from the climax and the film ended after a short denouement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a final indignity, the subtitles for the version we watched were generated by a neural net that had been trained on American TV news. It was not remotely up to the task and gave the impression that 1980s British criminals had words like \"Obama\" and \"podcast\" in their vocabulary.\\r\\n\\r\\n ', 'I never heard of Private Benjamin before \\'80s Month, but it was a deserved hit and started a mini-fad.

We decided that over the course of February, we would watch some big films from the 1990s, one for each year of the decade. These are movies that don\\'t often get programmed nowadays, and we chose ones I hadn\\'t seen back when they were in theaters, since Sumana\\'s more interested in rewatching films than I am.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreparing for this project was a ton of fun, and we now have a pretty big list of interesting-sounding \\'90s films for future Roundups. In the end, \"big\" usually meant \"big box office\", but for a couple of the years we made a decision based on lasting cultural impact or cult status. I didn\\'t want to watch a bunch of Disney animated features, folks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nTotal Recall (1990): All-time great PKD plot gets a second half that feels like an unused arc from Babylon 5\\'s crummy final season. I would forgive a great deal if it were possible to read the back half as an implanted memory of Verhoevanian excess, and there\\'s even internal evidence for this, but the screenplay must have got muddled in development hell because that explanation doesn\\'t wash. Basically, there are scenes from POVs other than Quaid\\'s; what could that possibly mean? Who\\'s having those experiences? \\r\\n\\r\\nPoint Break (1991): Over-the-top fun, from the ridiculous/beautiful action sequences to the goofy/sinister character development. \\r\\n\\r\\nSister Act (1992): Fun family comedy with a little action, in the vein of the older Disney comedies we\\'d rent when I was a kid. The Apple Dumpling Gang and whatnot. I loved the chase scenes through the casino, possibly because \"being in a room full of people whose hobby is making bad decisions; also there\\'s a buffet\" seems impossibly far away right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nSleepless In Seattle (1993): Meg Ryan\\'s character is a huge stalker, but when you live in a rom-com universe, stalking can be a positive-sum activity! A big feature of these universes is love at first sight, and when Annie hears Sam\\'s voice on the radio she gets clocked by love-at-first-sight. But due to the structure of mass media, Sam doesn\\'t know that Annie exists! The rest of the movie is basically Annie trying to close the love-at-first-sight circuit by making Sam look at her. And it almost works! But it takes a child\\'s faith and pre-9/11 security practices to finally get them both in shot for more than a couple seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 2006 in the Sleepless In Seattle universe, a dating website was created that showed you hundreds of pictures a minute to trigger the love-at-first-sight reaction. Once they had identified one side of a match, it was simple to complete the pairing. This website rapidly cleared the market for romance, ensuring that everyone got their Happily Ever After.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, Sumana and I suspect that a big part of this movie\\'s success was the way it showed technology\\'s ability to mediate romance over long distances. That\\'s old news now, but at various points in Sleepless in Seattle, animation is used to dramatize the physical distance between Seattle and Baltimore in a way that really jumps out now. Why spend that money on animation, and why pick two American cities that are about as far apart as you can get, if that isn\\'t super important to your film?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shawshank Redemption (1994): Of all the films in this list this is the one I really didn\\'t want to watch. It seemed long and monotonous. But if \"big\" is going to mean anything, it has to include the single highest-rated movie on IMDB.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, it was fine, and great fun in the final act. It\\'s probably no surprise to anyone that Stephen King occasionally reuses plot points, but I thought I\\'d casually mention that the core twist of this movie has a lot in common with the twist in The Eyes of the Dragon, King\\'s 1984 foray into high fantasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday (1995): This film has a lot of really funny supporting characters (our fave: Bernie Mac\\'s pastor) but it also has two main characters who don\\'t do much. IMO it takes the concept of \"audience stand-in\" too far to have your main characters sit in the driveway watching the other characters. Maybe I just don\\'t like stoner comedies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwister (1996): I definitely don\\'t like disaster movies, so I didn\\'t care for the action set pieces, except for the rescue from the wrecked house, which I\\'ll justify by saying it\\'s more of a suspense set piece. However, in Twister the disaster is small-scale and repeating, so it turns out to be a pretty fun story of the scientists who study the disaster. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s also a slobs-vs-snobs storyline which I\\'m pretty sure makes no difference at all to the plot. I believe every story beat would have happened  exactly the same way if the \"snob\" scientists didn\\'t exist. Maybe they were a late addition to the screenplay? Anyway, the real attraction here is the \"slob\" scientists, whose personalities and research are rendered very realistically. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those slobs was a bit character who\\'s one of the big reasons we chose this movie. Sumana saw this movie in theaters and was captivated by a character who she remembered as an Indian woman with short hair—a rare bit of \\'90s representation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe identified the doppelganger pretty quickly (see screenshot) and IMDB let us close the books on this investigation. That part is played by Wendle Josepher, who, unlike No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal, is not Indian. (Also, we\\'d seen her before, in a small part in Intolerable Cruelty.) Still a representational victory for women scientists with short hair. Please note the floppy hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n Air Force One (1997): This is good fun, but equating the President\\'s leadership with his ability to personally kick ass creates obvious perverse incentives, especially given how easy the latter is to fake. I don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence that Donald Trump used the Air Force One soundtrack at campaign rallies. Not blaming Air Force One for this; it\\'s just taking an attitude that already exists and using it as the premise for a diehardlike. \\r\\n\\r\\nBreakdown: the stuff on the plane was great, the scenes back at the White House were fun, especially the press pool. (\"Madame Vice President! Is the President barefoot?\" \"Does he have a machine gun yet?\") Everything else was pretty dull, especially the ticking time bomb with what\\'s-his-face being released from the Shawshank Redemption prison and sloooowly walking out to the yard like the guy going up the steps in Becket (1964). Just gimme a plane and people exiting the plane in unorthodox ways. William H. Macy was a nice surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will concede that if the American head of government was separate from the head of state, it\\'d make sense to have the head of state be someone who\\'s really good at kicking ass and doing patriotic stunts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPleasantville (1998): William H. Macy is no surprise at all in this story of human beings who act like Sphex wasps, a dimension so square that a couple dorky \\'90s kids can casually start a revolution. This was really fun and creative. Really my only issue with Pleasantville is yet another problem that seems to have come out of multiple screenplay revisions: what\\'s up with the Don Knotts character?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think this movie needs a framing device at all—I\\'d do this story entirely inside Pleasantville as a B-movie apocalypse story. But I can see how that wouldn\\'t pass muster with \\'90s studio execs. So fine, framing device, Don Knotts, magic remote control, got it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the issue becomes the actions of that character. Over the course of the movie he becomes more and more angry at our real-world heroes and how they\\'re screwing up his perfect bubble universe. In the climax of the movie, David a) permanently \"ruins\" Pleasantville and b) reenters the real world where Don Knotts can get to him. That was a mistake! Now he\\'s really going to give him what for! Now he\\'s... driving away? He doesn\\'t even seem mad? This movie shifts a major character offstage at what should be his big scene, and we don\\'t care because the story\\'s over and who needs that guy. That is, to me, an indication that the character did not need to be in the film at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW, big thumbs-up to Joan Allen, who plays an excellent space alien in this film, coming right after her role in Face/Off (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\nNotting Hill (1999): In Sleepless In Seattle, the romance took place almost entirely in the woman\\'s head. Now, here\\'s a rom-com fantasy for the guys, in which a famous woman falls in love with a rando. A great supporting cast and fun dialogue makes the premise believablish. I was impressed by how much work they put into the films-within-the-film.\\r\\n\\r\\nMo\\' Better Blues (1990): After reaching 1999 near the end of the month, we started back in 1990 with the goal of focusing on smaller movies. But we only got one movie into that plan—turns out February\\'s shorter than other months! Mo\\' Better Blues isn\\'t perfect—if your film\\'s Wikipedia page has a section called \"Anti Defamation League controversy\" you\\'ve got a big problem—but I liked the plot arc, a nice twist on the \"tortured genius\" storyline with a sweet resolution. Bleek loses the thing he loves most and is able to come to terms with it because he\\'s got friends and family. Sort of Kieślowskian.\\r\\n\\r\\nI generally like it when a screenwriter/director writes a part for themselves, and I think it\\'s great here. Spike Lee\\'s character is constantly humiliated and beaten up, but gets one moment of awesome: a scene where he has the perfect opportunity to say \"Hey, I\\'m walkin\\' here!\" Truly, a New York dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nThis was a fun experience and in fact we\\'re keeping it going: we\\'ve already deemed March to be \\'80s Month and watched a fun film from 1980. It does look like I\\'ve seen most of the big \\'80s movies that are still remembered by people my age, so this month is likely to be more of a \"forgotten gem\" thing. Still fun though! ', 'Preparing for this project was a ton of fun, and we now have a pretty big list of interesting-sounding \\'90s films for future Roundups. In the end, \"big\" usually meant \"big box office\", but for a couple of the years we made a decision based on lasting cultural impact or cult status. I didn\\'t want to watch a bunch of Disney animated features, folks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nTotal Recall (1990): All-time great PKD plot gets a second half that feels like an unused arc from Babylon 5\\'s crummy final season. I would forgive a great deal if it were possible to read the back half as an implanted memory of Verhoevanian excess, and there\\'s even internal evidence for this, but the screenplay must have got muddled in development hell because that explanation doesn\\'t wash.

In the climax of the movie, David a) permanently \"ruins\" Pleasantville and b) reenters the real world where Don Knotts can get to him. That was a mistake! Now he\\'s really going to give him what for! Now he\\'s... driving away? He doesn\\'t even seem mad? This movie shifts a major character offstage at what should be his big scene, and we don\\'t care because the story\\'s over and who needs that guy. That is, to me, an indication that the character did not need to be in the film at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW, big thumbs-up to Joan Allen, who plays an excellent space alien in this film, coming right after her role in Face/Off (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\nNotting Hill (1999): In Sleepless In Seattle, the romance took place almost entirely in the woman\\'s head. Now, here\\'s a rom-com fantasy for the guys, in which a famous woman falls in love with a rando. A great supporting cast and fun dialogue makes the premise believablish. I was impressed by how much work they put into the films-within-the-film.\\r\\n\\r\\nMo\\' Better Blues (1990): After reaching 1999 near the end of the month, we started back in 1990 with the goal of focusing on smaller movies. But we only got one movie into that plan—turns out February\\'s shorter than other months! Mo\\' Better Blues isn\\'t perfect—if your film\\'s Wikipedia page has a section called \"Anti Defamation League controversy\" you\\'ve got a big problem—but I liked the plot arc, a nice twist on the \"tortured genius\" storyline with a sweet resolution. Bleek loses the thing he loves most and is able to come to terms with it because he\\'s got friends and family. Sort of Kieślowskian.\\r\\n\\r\\nI generally like it when a screenwriter/director writes a part for themselves, and I think it\\'s great here. Spike Lee\\'s character is constantly humiliated and beaten up, but gets one moment of awesome: a scene where he has the perfect opportunity to say \"Hey, I\\'m walkin\\' here!\" Truly, a New York dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n', 'Anyway, it was fine, and great fun in the final act. It\\'s probably no surprise to anyone that Stephen King occasionally reuses plot points, but I thought I\\'d casually mention that the core twist of this movie has a lot in common with the twist in The Eyes of the Dragon, King\\'s 1984 foray into high fantasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriday (1995): This film has a lot of really funny supporting characters (our fave: Bernie Mac\\'s pastor) but it also has two main characters who don\\'t do much. IMO it takes the concept of \"audience stand-in\" too far to have your main characters sit in the driveway watching the other characters. Maybe I just don\\'t like stoner comedies.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwister (1996): I definitely don\\'t like disaster movies, so I didn\\'t care for the action set pieces, except for the rescue from the wrecked house, which I\\'ll justify by saying it\\'s more of a suspense set piece. However, in Twister the disaster is small-scale and repeating, so it turns out to be a pretty fun story of the scientists who study the disaster. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\'s also a slobs-vs-snobs storyline which I\\'m pretty sure makes no difference at all to the plot. I believe every story beat would have happened  exactly the same way if the \"snob\" scientists didn\\'t exist. Maybe they were a late addition to the screenplay? Anyway, the real attraction here is the \"slob\" scientists, whose personalities and research are rendered very realistically. \\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those slobs was a bit character who\\'s one of the big reasons we chose this movie. Sumana saw this movie in theaters and was captivated by a character who she remembered as an Indian woman with short hair—a rare bit of \\'90s representation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe identified the doppelganger pretty quickly (see screenshot) and IMDB let us close the books on this investigation. That part is played by Wendle Josepher, who, unlike No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal, is not Indian. (Also, we\\'d seen her before, in a small part in Intolerable Cruelty.) Still a representational victory for women scientists with short hair. Please note the floppy hat.\\r\\n\\r\\n Air Force One (1997): This is good fun, but equating the President\\'s leadership with his ability to personally kick ass creates obvious perverse incentives, especially given how easy the latter is to fake. I don\\'t think it\\'s a coincidence that Donald Trump used the Air Force One soundtrack at campaign rallies. Not blaming Air Force One for this; it\\'s just taking an attitude that already exists and using it as the premise for a diehardlike. \\r\\n\\r\\nBreakdown: the stuff on the plane was great, the scenes back at the White House were fun, especially the press pool. (\"Madame Vice President! Is the President barefoot?\" \"Does he have a machine gun yet?\") Everything else was pretty dull, especially the ticking time bomb with what\\'s-his-face being released from the Shawshank Redemption prison and sloooowly walking out to the yard like the guy going up the steps in Becket (1964). Just gimme a plane and people exiting the plane in unorthodox ways. William H. Macy was a nice surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will concede that if the American head of government was separate from the head of state, it\\'d make sense to have the head of state be someone who\\'s really good at kicking ass and doing patriotic stunts.\\r\\n\\r\\nPleasantville (1998): William H. Macy is no surprise at all in this story of human beings who act like Sphex wasps, a dimension so square that a couple dorky \\'90s kids can casually start a revolution. This was really fun and creative. Really my only issue with Pleasantville is yet another problem that seems to have come out of multiple screenplay revisions: what\\'s up with the Don Knotts character?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think this movie needs a framing device at all—I\\'d do this story entirely inside Pleasantville as a B-movie apocalypse story. But I can see how that wouldn\\'t pass muster with \\'90s studio execs. So fine, framing device, Don Knotts, magic remote control, got it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the issue becomes the actions of that character. Over the course of the movie he becomes more and more angry at our real-world heroes and how they\\'re screwing up his perfect bubble universe. In the climax of the movie, David a) permanently \"ruins\" Pleasantville and b) reenters the real world where Don Knotts can get to him. That was a mistake! Now he\\'s really going to give him what for! Now he\\'s... driving away? He doesn\\'t even seem mad? This movie shifts a major character offstage at what should be his big scene, and we don\\'t care because the story\\'s over and who needs that guy. That is, to me, an indication that the character did not need to be in the film at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW, big thumbs-up to Joan Allen, who plays an excellent space alien in this film, coming right after her role in Face/Off (1997).\\r\\n\\r\\nNotting Hill (1999): In Sleepless In Seattle, the romance took place almost entirely in the woman\\'s head.

Mo\\' Better Blues isn\\'t perfect—if your film\\'s Wikipedia page has a section called \"Anti Defamation League controversy\" you\\'ve got a big problem—but I liked the plot arc, a nice twist on the \"tortured genius\" storyline with a sweet resolution. Bleek loses the thing he loves most and is able to come to terms with it because he\\'s got friends and family.

That's right, it's time for a second edition of Pandemic Reading Roundup. I'm not in a mood for detailed reviews so I'll just recommend my favorites of this batch:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nSmallbone Deceased by Michael Gilbert\\r\\nDeath Sentences by Kawamata Chiaki \\r\\nThe Unconquerable World by Jonathan Schell\\r\\nThe Honor Code by Kwame Anthony Appiah\\r\\nThe Flu Swatter by Nicholas Dawidoff\\r\\n\\nI also have an anti-honorable mention: Len Deighton's 1964 spy novel Funeral in Berlin. It occupies a space halfway between Ian Fleming and John le Carré, a space that in retrospect doesn't really need occupation. I mention this not-great book in this post when I let many decent books pass without notice only because there's a reason why my wishlist included two Len Deighton novels. Deighton wrote a really good novel in 1978, SS-GB, an alt-history about the impossibility of selective collaboration with evil, which I read many years ago. Big recommendation for that one. It doesn't seem like his other work is similar, though.\\r\\n \", \"I also have an anti-honorable mention: Len Deighton's 1964 spy novel Funeral in Berlin.

Shortly thereafter, chance reunited me with the correct metadata for the book: Twistor, by John Cramer, published 1989. I bought a copy and went through it, looking to nail down the influences.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy original plan was just to skim the book, and the first part is very skimmable; but pretty soon I was reading the book for real, because not only does it get really interesting after the setup is complete, it turns out the influences on my work were not limited to Situation Normal. This isn\\'t too surprising because, looking back, there\\'s a good chance Twistor was the first science fiction for grownups I read. So, big thanks to John Cramer. Here\\'s what I found:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, I misremembered the goal of the scientists when I wrote my author commentary. They\\'re not trying to create a teleportation device; they\\'re doing Ph.D-level research on a combination of real physics and technobabble. The closest we come to a practical application has to do with a new medium for data storage. This would presumably replace the retro-future \"laser disks\" we see the characters using. I guess technically CDs are \"laser disks\"; we should have called them that but I understand why we didn\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I was more or less right about the plot device that comes out of these experiments: a phenomenon that can be exploited to swap matter among the six parallel universes that inhabit the same space as our universe. This phenomenon is at the core of the children-in-peril subplot, a couple of pre-Jurassic Park siblings who are caught up in an improbable case of skip overlap (to use Situation Normal terminology), very similar to what happens in Chapter 8 of Situation Normal. There\\'s a subplot about sighting the stars on the other side of the skip bubble, similar to how the cops in Situation Normal will track you when you skip. Nothing comes of it, though, since in Twistor those are completely different stars that formed in the parallel universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat skip-overlap incident also slices off a goon\\'s hand at the wrist; and, in the book\\'s goriest scene, the twistor phenomenon is used to dig a spherical chunk right out of another goon\\'s brain. This is a form of murder that the Seattle police are surprisingly cool with. I get it, I wouldn\\'t want to write about that investigation either. Characters in Situation Normal joke and speculate about injuries from skip overlap, but it doesn\\'t happen onscreen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far back as I can remember I\\'ve imagined forests of giant trees as being a standard science fiction trope—that\\'s Alien Ring in Constellation Games. But apart from Twistor, all the examples I can think of are a) fantasy and b) a single world-spanning Yggdrasil-like tree, not a forest of trees that are just really big. I suspect I got that idea from this one formative book, whose shadow universe features a forest of very memorable giant trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose giant trees have a scent like cedar. That may be why I named the planet in Situation Normal Cedar Commons, but that\\'s a big stretch IMO. I wouldn\\'t have remembered that detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, there\\'s a fantasy story-within-the-story, analogous to the \"Princess Denweld\" adventure in Situation Normal, but I didn\\'t remember that from my initial reading, and it\\'s such a common technique that I can\\'t imagine I got it from here; especially since I was consciously parodying a different book when I wrote \"Princess Denweld\".\\r\\n\\r\\nA totally random thing I did remember: at one point a character sings a Pynchon-esque song and I remembered music that I made up for that song! I know it\\'s my music because a) there\\'s no record of this song existing outside Twistor and b) when I came up with the music, I dropped a word from the lyrics and got the meter wrong. No influence on anything, but a fun example of all the weird stuff we have buried deep in our memories.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwistor contains a fair amount of realistic 1980s password-cracking and 1337 skullduggery—man-in-the-middle attacks, false-front BBSes, etc. Most of this skulduggery is carried out on \"HyperVAX\" systems, and exploits real features of VMS. As a kid I lapped this up—I think it was my first glimpse of the cool things grownups could do with computers. I was way more interested in concepts like email and BBSes—within five years I\\'d be running my own BBS—than in any of the hax0r stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is one of those sci-fi books where the climax involves spreading the forbidden knowledge to all and sundry. I agree that\\'s probably the best move in the situation the book sets up, but I can\\'t say I share the narrator\\'s optimism. I feel like the jerk at the wedding saying \"I give this planet six months.\" Anyway, the method by which our heroes spread the forbidden knowledge is... mailing list spam! They evade the watchful eye of the FBI by sending out their preprints through a BITNET distribution list, rather than making an easily-stopped trip to the FedEx store.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a very useful afterword, Cramer does his own author commentary, separating physics fact from speculation and explaining that the hax0r techniques described are \"all known techniques which have been used to penetrate protected computer systems\", but that they\\'re all now being defended against and you should not use them for real. That\\'s a little disingenous IMO. Many of these techniques are alive and well today—installing a trojan  keylogger on someone\\'s computer to capture their passwords—even though VMS itself is dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I\\'m going to reproduce the last two paragraphs of the afterword verbatim, because it\\'s a great piece of computer history:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBitNet is an actual worldwide computer network that is already in very active use by the physics community. However, at present it is used primarily for \"mail\" messages between users and for the transmission of data files and programs. It is not in general use for the transmission of scientific papers and preprints because these usually include a number of figures; for example, line drawings of equipment or data plots. Although CompuServe\\'s GIF standard, Adobe\\'s Post Script, and several others are looming on the horizon, there is presently no universal graphics standard that would permit the routine inclusion of figures in scientific papers, and so they are still distributed by conventional mail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a good bet that this will soon change. The scientific journals published by the American Institute of Physics, e.g., Physical Review, already accept manuscripts submitted on computer media. It is very likely that within a decade physics papers for journal publication complete with drawings and figures will be submitted and preprints of such papers will be routinely circulated by BitNet or its successor. One can only hope that publishers of works of fiction (like the present novel) will also eventually emerge from the nineteenth century and adopt similar technology.\\r\\n ', 'My original plan was just to skim the book, and the first part is very skimmable; but pretty soon I was reading the book for real, because not only does it get really interesting after the setup is complete, it turns out the influences on my work were not limited to Situation Normal.

Fortunately this month there are only three movies to connect in a web of fun:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nQuartet (2012): A pretty enjoyable dramedy that gives older actors the chance to ham it up. We got two dramatic characters and two funny characters, the plot hits the beats in the order you think it will, it\\'s fine; the pleasure is mostly in enjoying the British Acting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nBonus connection to last month\\'s Irma La Douce: Famous singer comes to town.\\r\\n\\nSpeed (1994): This is really, really fun, and captures the feel of Los Angeles around the time I was living there in college. In fact, here\\'s a story I\\'ve apparently never told before: when I was in college I saw a Santa Monica bus like the one in Speed get hit by a car! No one was hurt, everyone got off the bus and started filling out forms. I actually remember being on the bus when it was hit, and filling out a form with a little stub pencil, but I\\'m not claiming that because it\\'s easy to confabulate that kind of memory. My point is, Speed takes certain liberties with the sturdiness of that kind of bus. One tap and it\\'s down for the count.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bigger problem with Speed is that the core middle bit, on the bus, is such a perfect action sequence that it\\'s been raptured straight to Movie Heaven. The subplot about the bad guy and the two completely different transportation-based set pieces that flank the bus sequence are Left Behind, looking cheesy and sheepish by comparison. I mean, you\\'ve probably seen Speed and it\\'s probably been a while. Do you remember the elevator sequence? No, I\\'m pretty sure you\\'re thinking of Die Hard. Or maybe Gremlins 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeed is nearly two hours long. Much as I love any time the LA Metro shows up on screen (hello, Captain Marvel), you coulda cut that whole sequence, saved a bunch of money, and packed in two or three more showings per day of a ninety-minute Speed in a busy multiplex.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be great if last year\\'s showing of Gravity and this year\\'s Speed acted as bookends on the pandemic, but it ain\\'t happening. I will point out that Sandra Bullock\\'s Speed character, like her Gravity character, spends a lot of time calling for help from people who can\\'t help her. But that\\'s not the movie I came here to find a connection with! How about:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nConnection with Quartet: Tune man.\\r\\n\\nThe Devil And Miss Jones (1941): A pretty fun film with some good old-timey New York jokes (\"I work at the automat. I have charge of blueberry pies.\") falls flat at the last possible minute by setting up a scenario where management recognition of a union is the only realistic way to achieve a happy ending and then... skipping right to the happy ending, letting you draw whatever conclusions you want about how the plot got there. Which side are you on? Which side are you on? Oh, definitely on your side, for sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis film has no creative connection to the similarly-named porno classic, to the extent that I wonder whether the director of The Devil In Mrs. Jones had heard the title but never seen the film. It seems like the common situation where you mishear something, decide your mishearing is cooler, and do your own thing based on the mishearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nConnection with Quartet: Romance blooms among the elderly.\\r\\nConnection with Speed: Bad cops.\\r\\n ', '\\nBonus connection to last month\\'s Irma La Douce: Famous singer comes to town.\\r\\n\\nSpeed (1994): This is really, really fun, and captures the feel of Los Angeles around the time I was living there in college.

Before we get into it, I have a request of you. If you\\'ve read\\r\\nand enjoyed Situation Normal, please tell other folks about it,\\r\\neither by writing a review or just mentioning it when books or science fiction come\\r\\nup in conversation. If you\\'re eligible for voting in awards like the Hugos, consider it when you place your 2020 votes—it came out late in the year but 2020 is its eligibility year. Constellation Games spread almost entirely\\r\\nthrough word of mouth and the same will be true of this book.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday I\\'m raising the curtain on three things that, in different\\r\\nsenses, come \"after\" Situation Normal. I do this this with some\\r\\ntrepidation because at the end I\\'m going to talk about a project in progress that is exciting but far from complete. But first, something\\r\\nthat\\'s totally done and just waiting for the right moment to spring on\\r\\nyou:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We, the Unwilling\"\\n\"We, the Unwilling\" is a bonus story I wrote after finishing the\\r\\n  first draft of Situation Normal. It\\'s a tall tale of an\\r\\n  Outreach Navy grunt who\\'s retrained as a superweapon after his\\r\\n  superiors discover he\\'s apparently immune to Evidence. There was no\\r\\n  way to tell this story in the main plotline, and at some point we\\'ll\\r\\n  be publishing it online to juice sales. Here\\'s a little\\r\\n  taste:\\n\\nThe rre doctor ratcheted thons exosuit into a standing\\r\\nposition. Kenta just sat there, unable to move, amazed that... well,\\r\\nhe was going to die, sure, but there was a chance he\\'d die with his\\r\\nshameful secret intact.\\r\\n\\r\\nKenta was immune to Evidence, but the explanation wasn\\'t\\r\\nphysiological. It was hiding in plain sight. Evidence turned\\r\\nbattle-hardened spacemen into cowards. It didn\\'t work on Kenta Imura\\r\\nbecause he was already a coward.\\r\\n\\nI reused one little plot point from this story in the final draft\\r\\nof Situation Normal, but it\\'s pretty minor. It\\'s the sort of\\r\\nthing that probably happens all the time, whenever two people struggle hand-to-hand for control of a spacecraft. Not a big\\r\\ndeal. Anyway, I\\'m looking forward to showing you the story!\\nNice Doggie\\nSeveral years ago, in a fit of excessive optimism, I wrote a short\\r\\npitch for a sequel to Situation Normal called Nice\\r\\nDoggie, a working title which I love but would surely have to\\r\\nchange. Here is the pitch exactly as I wrote it except with spelling\\r\\nerrors fixed:\\n\\n\"Diplomacy is the art of saying \\'nice doggie\\' until you can find a rock.\" - Human saying\\nSel has been promoted! As the colonial administrator of Resca, a\\r\\nTerran system captured during the war, it\\'s her responsibility to\\r\\nbring ninety million humans into full citizenship in the Fist of\\r\\nJoy. Not bad for someone whose previous major accomplishment was\\r\\nrunning an international trade show. There\\'s bound to be some initial\\r\\ntrouble with some dead-enders, but once the humans get a taste of a\\r\\nfully functional modern economy, they\\'ll never want to leave the\\r\\nFist.\\nJamey Pandit of the Terran Diplomatic Corps is starting to wonder\\r\\nwhy he even bothers saving the galaxy. Time after time he\\'s bailed out\\r\\nhis doddering superiors, and his reward is one punishment assignment\\r\\nafter another. This time he\\'s the passport officer at the Terran\\r\\nconsulate on Resca, a planet that shouldn\\'t even have a consulate\\r\\nbecause we shouldn\\'t have given it away. Still, even on a backwater\\r\\nthere are plenty of opportunities for advancing humanity\\'s\\r\\ninterests—and making a little money on the side.\\nNice Doggie does for interstellar diplomacy\\r\\n  what Situation Normal does for interstellar war. Inspired by\\r\\n  Keith Laumer\\'s Retief stories, it is intended as a sequel\\r\\n  to Situation Normal but it can be told in a different setting\\r\\n  as a standalone story.\\n\\nYou can see the Retief stand-in there, I won\\'t insult your\\r\\nintelligence. I will say I gasped when I reread this and realized I\\'d\\r\\nmade Bolupeth Vo\\'s girlfriend one of the POV characters.\\nIs this likely to happen? Probably not. I\\'m still searching through\\r\\n  new fictional universes, looking for the one that will hit it\\r\\n  big. Except, that\\'s exactly what I said about a Constellation\\r\\n  Games sequel, and...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constellation Speedrun\\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, I was about 5,000 words\\r\\n  into a novel about a post-scarcity society that abruptly stops being\\r\\n  post-scarcity. This was shaping up to be one depressing-ass\\r\\n  book. Situation Normal doesn\\'t have a traditional happy\\r\\n  ending, but the war does end and some of the survivors are working\\r\\n  to break the cycle of violence. This was a real end-of-the-world novel,\\r\\n  and with the world actually ending around me, I just couldn\\'t write\\r\\n  it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I did what for ten years I\\'d said I wouldn\\'t do: I went back to\\r\\n  the Constellation universe. Constellation Games wasn\\'t the\\r\\n  commercial success I\\'d hoped for, but it\\'s become a bit of a cult\\r\\n  classic, and writing in that universe means accepting strict rules\\r\\n  about how bad things can get for humanity. To quote Ariel, \"we did\\r\\n  nothing but fuck this up from beginning to end, and it probably\\r\\n  turned out okay.\" Those rules gave me the guardrails I needed to\\r\\n  face the blank page and write through what I hope will turn out to\\r\\n  have been the worst year of my life. (I\\'m preemptively disqualifying\\r\\n  the year where I actually die.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m currently 30,000 words into The Constellation\\r\\n    Speedrun. Maybe thirty percent of the way to a rough\\r\\n    draft. It\\'s slow going, and I don\\'t usually talk about incomplete\\r\\n    manuscripts, but this isn\\'t a novel I\\'m writing for sale. I\\'m\\r\\n    writing it for myself and for you.  I hope I can sell it,\\r\\n    but if I have to I\\'ll self-pub or just put it online for\\r\\n    fans. This novel is my coping mechanism and I will finish it\\r\\n    eventually.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny attempt to describe The Constellation Speedrun runs into\\r\\n  the reticence that led me not to tell you about the project in the\\r\\n  first place, so I\\'ll just say that it takes place about ten years\\r\\n  after Constellation Games, starring new characters who were\\r\\n  little kids at the time of first contact, with old favorites like Jenny and Tetsuo\\r\\n  returning in cameos or small parts. I\\'m trying to capture the same\\r\\n  freewheeling, idea-packed feel of Constellation Games but\\r\\n  with a much tighter plot and in an average word\\r\\n  count for a science fiction novel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nThus ends the commentary! Again, if you have any questions about Situation Normal feel free to ask, and I hope to see you again soon!

Athena mentioned that Candlemark & Gleam had gotten a lot\\r\\n of complaints through the Kindle system about typoes\\r\\n in Constellation Games. Now, I know of at least two serious\\r\\n errors in Constellation Games (peoples\\' names are wrong) and\\r\\n one day I hope to do another press run to fix them, but I\\'m not\\r\\n talking about legitimate errors here. I\\'m talking about words\\r\\n like... just skimming Constellation Games to find an\\r\\n example... \"pakpapur\". Which I suspect I composed from spice-sounding\\r\\n English words like \"paprika\" and \"pepper\" but which is also clearly a\\r\\n made-up space alien word. ', 'Apparently at one point these Kindle complaints reached such a\\r\\npitch that Amazon threatened to flag Constellation Games as a\\r\\nlow-quality typofest, surely with a deleterious effect on\\r\\nsales. So Athena suggested I add something to the beginning of\\r\\nthe Situation Normal manuscript explaining that \"uhaltihaxl\"\\r\\nand \"Dwap-Jac-Dac\" are spelled that way on purpose and there\\'s no need\\r\\nto write in unless you find a regular English word being\\r\\nmisused. (This certainly happens! I found some in the final manuscript\\r\\nwhile writing this commentary!)', \"My first reaction was, I got really defensive about this\\r\\nrequest. This is a novel where major characters murder each other, and\\r\\nyou want me to put a warning at the front of the book\\r\\nabout spelling? I don't think every book needs a content\\r\\nwarning at the front, but a lot of bad shit goes down in Situation\\r\\nNormal, and if I'm going to put any kind of note at the beginning\\r\\nof the book it's got to be a heads-up about that.\", \"This turned out to be the key to compromise. I wrote one last piece\\r\\nof in-universe text, as though Situation Normal were a potboiler\\r\\nadventure novel published in the Terran Outreach and stocked alongside\\r\\nthe Down Under Crew novelizations. This fits in conceptually\\r\\nwith the main theme of the novel—people living and dying by\\r\\nfantastic narratives. It lets me do the content warning, and\\r\\nincidentally I can explain the spelling stuff, in terms of an in-universe\\r\\nstandards body which sets down how to transliterate words between\\r\\nlanguages. It's still pedantic as hell, but hopefully it doesn't sound\\r\\npatronizing.\", 'Which reminds me: Situation Normal was originally written in\\r\\nCommonwealth English, that being the in-universe \"human language\" by\\r\\nthe same science fiction logic that makes Narathippin \"the uhaltihaxl\\r\\nlanguage\". I converted it to American English pretty late in the\\r\\nprocess for the same reason I wrote the content note: apparently\\r\\nAmericans see \"honour\" or \"manoeuvre\" and smash that \"Report Content\\r\\nError\" button.

My original concept was a science-fiction Song of Ice and\\r\\nFire-type epic with many overlapping points of\\r\\nview. Unfortunately, this made the novel unsaleable—that length\\r\\nis the main reason you didn't see this novel years ago. Fantasy\\r\\nreaders will devour 182k words and come back for the other two books\\r\\nin the trilogy, but science fiction novels usually run around\\r\\n80k-100k. Constellation Games is around 120k which is already\\r\\nreally big.\", 'To sell Situation Normal I had to cut the word count down to\\r\\nno more than 150k. (Final count is about 147k.) I also rearranged\\r\\nscenes to dramatically cut the number of POV switches—frequent\\r\\nswitches work for television but put too much cognitive load on a\\r\\nreader. ', \"To get to 147k I had to cut a couple subplots and some fun\\r\\nscenes. In today's commentary I'll list the main ones and mourn them with\\r\\nsome choice quotes.\", 'The bakery that only sells flowers: First, a scene that was\\r\\nrewritten rather than deleted. I did a lot of \"writing the other\" in\\r\\nthis book, and took critiques from a number of sensitivity readers. I\\r\\nwant to highlight a big change I made with the help of a sensitivity\\r\\nreader.', 'In the draft I sold, when Den enters the awareness station\\r\\non Magna Carta she is overwhelmed by a \"horrible stay-away\\r\\nsmell\" which turns out to be Churryhoof\\'s must telling Den, fellow\\r\\nuhaltihaxl female, to scram. Sensitivity reader: \"[T]his was such a\\r\\nsort of familiar scene (older-lady sexuality is stinky and\\r\\nembarrassing) that I kind of wanted the exact opposite.\"', 'When I get any kind of critique, I try to find a way of addressing\\r\\nit while also improving the story in other respects. That attitude\\r\\nshort-circuits my defense mechanisms and moves the focus away from\\r\\nwhether I personally think a critique is reasonable.', 'In this case I do think the critique is reasonable—that was\\r\\nlazy writing— and the sensitivity reader also provided a good\\r\\nsolution. \"The exact opposite\"—Churryhoof\\'s pheromones smelling\\r\\nso good that it makes Den woozy—made just as much sense\\r\\nas the cliche I\\'d written originally, and was a lot cooler.', 'Coffee: In the second draft I wrote an introductory scene\\r\\nthat basically does the job of \"Four Kinds of Cargo.\" It walks you\\r\\nthrough the Outreach, the Fist of Joy, the differences between them,\\r\\nand the fact that they\\'re about to go to war.', \"The scene stars Styrqot, everyone's favorite doomed dad. Just\\r\\nbefore the war starts, he's importing a shipment of coffee beans from\\r\\nthe Outreach. He gets a cursory inspection from Outreach customs, and\\r\\nthen a more thorough inspection from the Fist. One of the customs\\r\\ninspectors mocks Styrqot for importing luxury goods instead of going\\r\\noff into glorious battle.\", '\"Due respect, ma\\'am, I won\\'t take this from you. I ran logistics in\\r\\nthe last war.\"', '\"Oh, the war we lost!\" said the mehi-peri. \"Well,\\r\\nthank you for your service!\" She hopped down off the pallet. \"Excuse\\r\\nme, didn\\'t realize we had a fuckin\\' hero here.\"', \"Stung by this rebuke, Styrqot decides he'll do one little military\\r\\njob and call it even. Of course the 'job' turns out to be transporting\\r\\nVec to Cedar Commons, and you know the rest.\", 'There\\'s a little twist at the end which might make it plausible to\\r\\nturn this scene into a bonus story, but it\\'s not my best work. In the\\r\\ndraft I sold, I cut \"Coffee\" and moved the Battle of Unicorn Sector to\\r\\nthe start of the book, so we could open with an exciting\\r\\nset-piece. But eventually I moved that scene back to its original\\r\\nplace, to preserve chronological order. The book now starts exactly as\\r\\nI originally wrote it: nice and quiet, with Hiroko waking Becky on\\r\\nCedar Commons.', \"Overall I feel like I tried a bunch of flashy stuff to sell the\\r\\nbook, but it didn't make\\r\\nthe story any better and I should have focused on cutting the word\\r\\ncount.\", \"Fish Dinner: In the first draft, our first glimpse of Sour Candy is from\\r\\nKol's point of view.

It peels off and starts following\\r\\nKol as he climbs into the stolen hovercar. The POV has changed and we\\r\\nare now seeing things from the \"enemy\" perspective.', 'Admiral Norton: In the final draft, Mrs. Chen shows up to\\r\\n  Cedar Commons immediately after Sour Candy bugs out. She gets\\r\\n  there quickly because she never stopped tracking Sour Candy\\r\\n  after \"Four Kinds of Cargo\". This definitely keeps the story moving,\\r\\n  but there\\'s a great scene I cut, where Churryhoof brought Brown\\r\\n  v. Board of Education of Topeka back to the fleet in disgrace,\\r\\n  was relieved of command, and lectured by an Admiral Norton,\\r\\n  apparently one of her mentors. This is\\r\\n  the \"tradition of\\r\\n  glorious suicide\" scene I mentioned in my weblog a while\\r\\n  back.', \"The mystery of why Churryhoof is being given the kid-glove\\r\\ntreatment, given the horrible thing she did on Cedar Commons, was\\r\\nsolved when Norton announced that Churryhoof was being reassigned to\\r\\nEcho Division under Mrs. Chen—Chen heard about that horrible\\r\\nthing and saw it as showing a promising Echo Division mindset. Chen\\r\\nand Churryhoof then go right back to Cedar Commons, which in\\r\\nretrospect was kind of silly, so it's a good cut overall.\", 'Until I made this edit, Brown v. Board was a pretty big\\r\\noperation, crewing maybe fifty people. Because of this edit I had to\\r\\nmake it much smaller—I couldn\\'t have dozens of people left on\\r\\nboard after the loss of the scoop, because everyone except Churryhoof\\r\\nmust be moved quickly offstage. So now Brown v. Board starts\\r\\nout with a crew of seven. This caused some rank inflation—do you\\r\\nreally need two officers on the equivalent of a Swift\\r\\nBoat?—which I didn\\'t bother fixing, under \"ten percent more\\r\\naccurate than Star Trek\" rules.', 'Here\\'s a fun paragraph I cut from the return voyage to Cedar\\r\\nCommons, when Churryhoof sees Mrs. Chen seemingly dead (she\\'s actually\\r\\non an Evidence trip). \"No acknowledged rank\" is a thing from earlier\\r\\ndrafts. You can see why I had to cut this bit, given all the\\r\\nexplanation I just had to give:', \"And this might be my favorite joke in the whole project, a rare\\r\\nmoment when Situation Normal flat-out becomes a Star\\r\\nTrek parody.

At that point there\\r\\nwas an act break and the story skipped ahead a few weeks, letting\\r\\nthings mellow for a while. I removed this gap to make the story move\\r\\nat an even pace. This gave me the opportunity to cut a lot of scenes,\\r\\nincluding one I really like. During this gap, Becky emigrated to a\\r\\nplanet called Ototho and set up her marketing consultancy to the Fist\\r\\nof Joy:', 'It was going all right. A little data modeling, a little advice the\\r\\ncustomer could have gotten elsewhere, and some good old American\\r\\nflim-flam. The customers kept quiet about her.

If you\\'ve\\r\\n  read Constellation Games, you already know that I love\\r\\n  designing alien biologies and cultures. In Constellation\\r\\n  Games, each alien species had its own histories of war\\r\\n  and privation, which they\\'d transcended to become part of a\\r\\n  classic SF multi-species alliance. In Situation Normal, I\\r\\n  came up with two different takes on the \"multi-species alliance\"\\r\\n  trope and had them fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot for the first or last time, the setup in Situation\\r\\n  Normal comes out of a throwaway line in \"Four Kinds of\\r\\n  Cargo\". Specifically, when Kol goes out onto the Outreach space\\r\\n  station he mentions \"humans and their Outreach lackeys.\" This\\r\\n  implies a) the Fist sees itself as an alliance of equals, with the\\r\\n  Outreach dominated by humans, and b) there are at least two \"lackey\"\\r\\n  species. Basically, the Fist of Joy is how Star Trek\\'s Federation sees itself, and the Outreach is the Federation we actually see on screen most of the time.\\n Some of the Fist species have some flavor (e.g. the rest of\\r\\n  the Fist are squeezing the jetk into a gender binary where they\\r\\n  don\\'t really fit), but overall they\\'re designed to feel like a\\r\\n  disorganized mob where no one is in charge and you can\\'t even keep\\r\\n  track of everyone. The key line here is:\\nMyrus wondered if a species could quietly join the Fist of Joy without anyone noticing. With everyone thinking someone else had invited these weird-looking people.\\nWhereas the Terran Outreach is an empire consisting of three\\r\\n  species with well-defined cultures (plus brands). As Arun\\r\\n  sarcastically puts it: \"the nasty humans and their uhalti pets and\\r\\n  their rre attack dogs.\" \\nUhaltihaxl', 'Not for the first or last time, the setup in Situation\\r\\n  Normal comes out of a throwaway line in \"Four Kinds of\\r\\n  Cargo\".

And Myrus is a\\r\\nfluffy sheep person. He gets a moment of pain-debt-fueled badassery\\r\\nnear the end, but all he wants is to read fantasy novels and make\\r\\nfurniture. Churryhoof and Den are the ones who do bad stuff, and the\\r\\nsurprise (I hope) is that they don\\'t need pain debt to do\\r\\nthe really bad stuff—I\\'m thinking of Churryhoof\\'s\\r\\ndecision to draft the council kids and Den\\'s cold-blooded manipulation\\r\\nof Gearu.', 'The \"six percent\" conversation in Chapter 24 is important here:\\r\\nChurryhoof drafted the wrong kid. Myrus is in the six percent\\r\\nof uhalti who would never hurt anyone, and Den is at the other\\r\\nend of the bell curve, able to kill without remorse.', \"The other alien feature of the uhalti is that their extreme gender\\r\\nsegregation means no incest taboo. You're not even supposed to know\\r\\nwho your relatives are, so it can't matter, right? In various\\r\\ndrafts I went back and forth on whether Den and Myrus were actually\\r\\nrelated and/or romantically interested in each other, leading to a\\r\\nkind of wishy-washy Arrested Development level of humor.\", \"In the end my editor wanted me to make the uhalti as weird as\\r\\npossible, so I went all the way in the final draft, adding the\\r\\ntradition of concentration of genes, and Maskitenny's and Kemrush's\\r\\nattempt to put it into practice with Den and Myrus. And, of course,\\r\\nthe nearly-successful human attempt to wipe out that tradition, such\\r\\nthat Churryhoof (who's very conservative), is happy to see it being\\r\\nkept alive.\", 'One minor feature of the uhaltihaxl that I think should be present\\r\\n  in the next release of humanity: in chapter 16, Myrus is able to\\r\\n  \"close his ears\" by an act of will and not hear something annoying.', \"The rre are a body-snatching species who are also a colony-intelligence\\r\\n  species. It's a similar trick to Her from Constellation\\r\\n  Games—a collective intelligence whose components are\\r\\n  individually intelligent—but much more fine-grained.\", 'The rre are the opposite of the uhaltihaxl: they repulse humanoids\\r\\n  and have a horrifying biology but are generally nice people.

Jac is fluent in A and D, but to be effective as\\r\\na con artist in the Fist thon needs Ethiret\\'s fluency in B.', 'For characters who learned English through Trade Standard D, their\\r\\nEnglish speech is mainly rendered as a sequence of noun phrases. This\\r\\nis most obvious with the Chief (\"Kol, the dramatic reveal!\"), but we\\r\\nalso see it in the video ad for the Youth Festival (\"Our decision to\\r\\nsend you there!\"). You see how this works in detail at the Youth\\r\\nFestival itself, where Myrus watches a sentence get translated from\\r\\nEnglish to D, and the response get translated in the opposite\\r\\ndirection.', 'I had to add some clarifying bits to make it clear that the Chief\\r\\ndoesn\\'t talk like this all the time! She\\'s a native speaker of Trade\\r\\nStandard D, so when she talks with Kol, she sounds like she does in\\r\\n\"Four Kinds of Cargo\".

I changed \"the Captain\" to \"the Chief\"\\r\\n  because Situation Normal contains numerous characters who\\r\\n  have \"Captain\" as a military rank, but no equivalent of Master Chief\\r\\n  or Chief O\\'Brien. That sort of thing.', 'Since there\\'s no expectation you\\'ve read the short, Situation\\r\\nNormal only contains explicit references to \"Four Kinds of Cargo\"\\r\\nwhen that\\'s necessary for continuity purposes. Mainly we need to refer\\r\\nto Terequale Bitty, the crew member who dies in the first sentence of\\r\\n\"Four Kinds of Cargo\" and who in Situation Normal is replaced,\\r\\nbriefly, by Becky Twice. Becky sleeps in Terequale\\'s bed (if you can\\r\\ncall it sleeping) and inherits her coffee mug. The details are just\\r\\nEaster eggs—if you haven\\'t read \"Four Kinds of Cargo\" it may\\r\\nseem weird that Sour Candy had a quenny engineer, and I don\\'t\\r\\nexplain it. What\\'s important is, that engineer just died and her stuff\\r\\nis still on board, which makes room for Becky and sets up the\\r\\nexpectation that the crew on Sour Candy changes pretty\\r\\nfrequently.', 'In Situation Normal we learn that crew members usually\\r\\nleave Sour Candy not because they die (\"Four Kinds of Cargo\"\\r\\nsez Terequale Bitty was the first fatality) but because they\\'re\\r\\nromantically involved with the Chief, who dumps them. Were Terequale\\r\\nand the Chief lovers? I never had that in mind, and it doesn\\'t fit\\r\\nwith how anyone remembers Terequale in \"Four Kinds of Cargo\", but\\r\\nstatistically it\\'s likely.', 'Becky joins Sour Candy despite not having any of Terequale\\r\\nBitty\\'s skills, because the most important thing is having an odd\\r\\nnumber of people on board to prevent votes from ending in a tie. (This\\r\\nmay also explain Kol\\'s bad decision to hire Mrs. Chen in \"Four Kinds\\r\\nof Cargo\".) This was more prominent in an earlier draft\\r\\nof Situation Normal, where at one point there were four people\\r\\non the crew and they couldn\\'t agree on anything.', 'In Situation Normal it\\'s revealed that Mrs. Chen has been\\r\\ntracking Sour Candy, whereas in \"Four Kinds of Cargo\" it seems\\r\\nmore like she\\'s doing psyop work against Quennet. Going over \"Four\\r\\nKinds of Cargo\" and reconstructing what I may have been thinking back\\r\\nin 2012, it reads like Mrs. Chen was trying to get to Terequale Bitty\\r\\nor turn her somehow. So it\\'s a little weird that immediately after\\r\\ninfiltrating the crew (\"Four Kinds of Cargo\") she\\'d go right back to\\r\\nsecretly tracking them (Situation Normal).', 'In \"Four Kinds of Cargo\", Arun is described as not just the heavy\\r\\nbut the negotiator. At the beginning of Situation Normal we see\\r\\nhim pull the \"Bertie Wooster routine\" on Becky, but apart from that he\\r\\ndoesn\\'t negotiate very much—in particular, the Chief handles the\\r\\ndrug deal with Rooroo.', 'In the final draft of Situation Normal there are three references to the Cametrean tradition of ritual\\r\\ncannibalism (as modified by Kol in \"Four Kinds of Cargo\"), all of which come from people mocking Ethiret and none of which are explained. The first draft contained actual cannibalism: the food served at the monastery\\r\\nwas not neutral soup, but a Tupperware containing a jellied corestin\\r\\narm:', 'Finally, this is more of an Easter egg, but the purple dress the\\r\\nChief wears in \"Four Kinds of Cargo\" comes from the rasme thau casino\\r\\nDen visits at the end of Situation Normal—Den is given an\\r\\nidentical dress even though she\\'s a different species with a different\\r\\nbody shape. It\\'s the equivalent of the humiliation necktie they give\\r\\nyou at the fancy restaurant if you dare show up without a tie. I\\'m\\r\\nassuming they still do that but maybe it only happened in sitcoms. I\\r\\nwill say I\\'ve been to a couple fancy restaurants in my day, and I\\r\\nalways made sure to wear a jacket and tie to avoid Den\\'s fate.', \"The very first title of this book was The Furniture\\r\\nWar. Once I'd written a bit I wanted to call it Heavy\\r\\nEvidence (now the title of Part Two) but was foiled by genre\\r\\nreading conventions: that sounds like a mystery novel. Instead Sumana and I\\r\\nstarted calling it Explosion of Honour, a title I never\\r\\nseriously intended to use, but which set the mood as a parody of those\\r\\nBaen military fiction books with goofy cover paintings.\", 'Sumana came up with the title Situation Normal while we were brainstorming over dinner and from that moment on the book never had any other title. There are other books called Situation Normal, and there will probably be more in the future, so I hope we can all get along.', 'In 2007, I was doodling a novel set in 1960s Earth, called The\\r\\nMan From ARPA. A programmable hallucinogen fit with its\\r\\ncountercultural phone-phreaking theme. This is a quote from my\\r\\nnotes:', \"So Evidence has been in my head for a while. However, this idea did\\r\\nnot work with The Man From ARPA at all—the level of\\r\\nneuroscience you'd need to create it is way beyond a 1960s level. Even\\r\\nin the space-opera future, the Fist of Joy can't pull it off without\\r\\ncheating.\", 'Instead of The Man From ARPA I wrote \"Vanilla\", an\\r\\nunpublished novella featuring a synthetic hallucinogen that was not\\r\\ncalled Evidence but had a few similarities. \"Vanilla\"\\r\\nbecame Constellation Games, and Evidence finally saw\\r\\npublication with Situation Normal. At this point The Man\\r\\nFrom ARPA is well in the rear-view mirror, but the phone-phreaking\\r\\nplot is still a remote possibility—the core concept is clever\\r\\nand I haven\\'t seen anyone else use it. It would probably be a short\\r\\nstory, not a novel, and set on another planet, because I don\\'t like\\r\\ndoing historical research.', 'Keeping time in terms of \"shifts\" shows up in \"Four Kinds of Cargo\"\\r\\n  for the same reason I use 2x notation for everything in\\r\\n  \"The\\r\\n  Time Somn Died\". In a story with no human POV characters, time\\r\\n  won\\'t be measured in \"hours\" or \"days\", and using those words will\\r\\n  take the reader out of the story. This is always a challenge because\\r\\n  making up fake timekeeping words also takes the reader out of\\r\\n  the story, without even the benefit of explaining how long a period\\r\\n  of time has elapsed. A \"shift\" is a way humans have of keeping time\\r\\n  that isn\\'t directly tied to the planet Earth, so it served the\\r\\n  purpose.', 'I expanded the \"shifts\" idea a little in Situation Normal:\\r\\nthe Outreach does keep time using \"hours\" and \"days\", even\\r\\nthough this doesn\\'t make sense outside of Earth—part of the\\r\\nOutreach\\'s human chauvinism.', 'At some point I calculated exactly how long a shift was and\\r\\ncalibrated all the times in the book based on that number, but that\\r\\nwas a while before the final draft and if you try to make everything\\r\\nline up precisely I suspect you will be disappointed. The one rule\\r\\nthat has to work for plot purposes (it\\'s part of Yip-Goru\\'s conspiracy\\r\\ntheory) is that a kiloshift is approximately one Earth\\r\\nyear. This would make one shift about 8 hours and 45\\r\\nminutes—approximately the length of a \"shift\" of 20th-century\\r\\nAmerican work. In the end this doesn\\'t matter and you can get through\\r\\nthe book on Becky\\'s vague sense that \"[Fist] sitcoms ran five\\r\\ncentishifts, so ten hours maybe?\"', 'The Fist measures volume in the creatively-named \"volumes\", though in the final draft this is only used once, in a way that\\'s ambiguous. (\"A volume of Terran bourbon!\") I\\'m gonna say the ambiguity is intentional.', \"I dunno how the Fist measures distance; fortunately it doesn't\\r\\nmatter because of the way FTL works. Astronomical distance is measured\\r\\nin terms of the time, or number of skips, it will take to get\\r\\nthere. Speaking of which...\", 'I read a book around, like, 1989, which I\\'ve never been able to find since. I think the book was called Twister, so good luck finding it, and I\\'m pretty sure I read an ARC, so maybe its name changed or it was never even published. Anyway, in this book our intrepid scientists are trying to invent a teleportation machine. Instead, they make a machine that can \"twist\" a spherical volume of space, swapping it with the equivalent volume in a parallel Earth where humans never evolved.', 'In \"Four Kinds of Cargo\" the mechanism of FTL space travel is not\\r\\n  really spelled out, because I think that stuff is boring. But you\\r\\n  gotta spell it out in a novel that spans most of a galaxy, and I\\r\\n  like to have a mechanism that gives me some constraints and plot\\r\\n  toys, rather than just handwaving it and making space the size of\\r\\n  Rhode Island. In Constellation Games the FTL mechanism is\\r\\n  ports—moveable wormholes that connect two previously separate\\r\\n  points in spacetime. This gives me some cool plot toys, most of\\r\\n  which were stolen by the video game Portal, and the rest of\\r\\n  which you can read in that novel.', 'In Situation Normal the FTL mechanism is skipping, defined\\r\\nas the thing I suspect those scientists in the book I read\\r\\nwere trying to invent: something that swaps one spherical\\r\\nvolume of space with another. This gives me lots of cool plot toys:\\r\\nskip overlap, questions of what is \"spherical\" given that mass\\r\\ndistorts spacetime, and FTL as something that happens in discrete\\r\\nbursts (with capacitors that discharge) rather than\\r\\ncontinuously—more Battlestar Galactica than Star\\r\\nTrek.', \"The idea of encrypted matter, which shows up at the very end of the\\r\\nbook, is an idea I've had for a really long time and wasn't originally\\r\\nrelated to skipping as an FTL technology. I think at one point I\\r\\nintended to use it as a plot point in Constellation\\r\\nGames—something related to the shipping containers—and\\r\\nI will probably use it again in another story. It's too cool an idea\\r\\nto only use once as a minor plot point.\", 'Some other things I remember about the mysterious sci-fi book, in\\r\\ncase you want to try and find it where I have failed: there was a\\r\\nhacker character, possibly named Gordon, who frequented a l33t hax0r\\r\\nBBS with a false front. The hacker character would suffix \"-o\" to\\r\\nstatements for emphasis, e.g. \"sounds like some bullshit-o.\"', \"Constellation Games was full of fictional media and works of\\r\\n  art, and Situation Normal keeps up this enjoyable\\r\\n  tradition. The only fictional video game in Situation\\r\\n    Normal is the Snake-like game bundled on Myrus's\\r\\n  replacement Fist of Joy terminal, though I cut a couple when I cut\\r\\n  Crinoline White's storyline—Kol uses online games to launder money.\", 'More prominent in the novel are the crime dramas which first made\\r\\ntheir appearance in \"Four Kinds of\\r\\nCargo\"—primarily Nightside, Undeclared, and (Becky\\r\\nand Den\\'s favorite) The Down Under Crew.

At the beginning of the story, the crucial thing is to get your characters \"out on the board\" as quickly as possible.', 'One you do that (this is my own discovery and not part of Jim\\'s advice), you can get a long way through the plot by writing a scene for each pair of characters and seeing what they have to say to each other. I don\\'t know if anyone else does this as a conscious strategy but I see it happening a lot in ensemble TV shows like Star Trek. I did this in Constellation Games, e.g. \"Daisy and Ariel haven\\'t had a scene together, what would they say to each other?\" But this doesn\\'t quite work in Situation Normal because the characters spend most of the book in small, physically isolated groups. What I did instead was shuffle the groups.', 'In Situation Normal, Cedar Commons is the \"chessboard\". At the beginning of the book, most of the major characters are drawn to the planet. This lets me write \"before\" scenes with sets of characters who already know each other:', 'Then I turn on the particle accelerator. The Situation goes Normal, and all the characters are shuffled and flung back into space. Now the characters are separated again, but every grouping of characters contains wildcards:', 'Over the course of the book, the characters become even more isolated than this. Myrus is sent to the Youth Festival, Becky leaves Sour Candy. But at the end of the book everyone comes together a second time, at Nimar, pulled together by the gravitational pull of the plot.', \"Because the characters spend so much time in separate plotlines, a\\r\\n  lot of fun scenes didn't happen. Churryhoof and Myrus make things\\r\\n  very difficult for each other without ever meeting or even becoming aware of each other. Ethiret-Jac and the Chief only have the tiniest\\r\\n  interaction, but in that interaction I see the seed of an amazing\\r\\n  scene: those two are effectively the same character, and you can\\r\\n  just see how much they hate each other.\", \"I'm not crying over what might have been. This is a huge book. I cut major characters and plotlines to get to where we are today. But compared to Constellation Games, there are a whole lot of scenes I could have written but didn't.\", 'The Lebowski Connection', \"It's now a bit of a cliche to love The Big Lebowski, but it\\r\\n  went through a long wilderness period where it was dismissed as a\\r\\n  post-Fargo brain fart, so let me have this. I've loved The Big\\r\\n  Lebowski since opening day, March 6, 1998; and one of the things\\r\\n  I love about it is the plot, which is pretty tightly constructed\\r\\n  (not perfect) but seems random and incoherent because the POV\\r\\n  character doesn't understand what's going on. Since POV is so\\r\\n  tight, the moviegoer must see the film multiple times to piece\\r\\n  together what the Dude can't.\", \"In Constellation Games a whole lot of stuff could have been\\r\\n  cut without affecting Ariel's through-line (e.g. Ragtime and the\\r\\n  Mars mission). For Situation Normal I wanted to work on\\r\\n  tighter plotting, and naturally I took The Big Lebowski as my\\r\\n  model. The problem is, it's a bit much to ask someone to watch a\\r\\n  movie multiple times to understand the plot, and it's a non-starter\\r\\n  with a big novel. This only worked with The Big Lebowski\\r\\n  because it's funny as hell; even then it took years for the film\\r\\n  to get its due.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever. With multiple POV you can tell a complex story and\\r\\nthe reader will be able to keep up even as each\\r\\ncharacter stays in the dark. If you told the story of The Big\\r\\nLebowski from multiple POV (let's say the Dude, Bunny, and\\r\\nMaud—the three Lebowskis), you could tell the story all the way\\r\\nthrough in chronological order, it would make sense on first viewing,\\r\\nand the core elements of the comedy would come through just fine, because\\r\\nno one character would know what was happening. \\nWhen writing the first draft of Situation Normal, I worked\\r\\non a scene-by-scene basis and didn't really know where it was going\\r\\noverall. But I had a single guiding principle: all the major\\r\\ncharacters need to end up at the same place and play a crucial role in\\r\\na climax that fires every Chekhov's gun introduced over the course of\\r\\nthe book: Evidence, brands, pain debt, rre colonies, etc. No Return\\r\\nof the Jedi stuff (or, be fair, Constellation Games stuff)\\r\\nwhere entire subplots end up making no difference to the\\r\\noutcome.\\nIf Cedar Commons is the planet where everyone ends up together by\\r\\nchance, Nimar is the planet that everyone goes to intentionally. The\\r\\nmiddle part of the story equips everyone with the motive, means and\\r\\nopportunity to get to Nimar. Every major character has an individual\\r\\ncharacter arc as they proceed through the same plot arc, though some\\r\\ncharacters (Dwap-Jac-Dac) change more than others (Kol).\\nThen the climax fires all the Chekhov's guns, and the epilogue\\r\\n  draws the lifelines of the survivors a little bit past their second\\r\\n  point of intersection at Nimar.

But I had a single guiding principle: all the major\\r\\ncharacters need to end up at the same place and play a crucial role in\\r\\na climax that fires every Chekhov's gun introduced over the course of\\r\\nthe book: Evidence, brands, pain debt, rre colonies, etc. No Return\\r\\nof the Jedi stuff (or, be fair, Constellation Games stuff)\\r\\nwhere entire subplots end up making no difference to the\\r\\noutcome.\", 'If Cedar Commons is the planet where everyone ends up together by\\r\\nchance, Nimar is the planet that everyone goes to intentionally. The\\r\\nmiddle part of the story equips everyone with the motive, means and\\r\\nopportunity to get to Nimar. Every major character has an individual\\r\\ncharacter arc as they proceed through the same plot arc, though some\\r\\ncharacters (Dwap-Jac-Dac) change more than others (Kol).', \"Then the climax fires all the Chekhov's guns, and the epilogue\\r\\n  draws the lifelines of the survivors a little bit past their second\\r\\n  point of intersection at Nimar. It gives you a little cooldown\\r\\n  without changing the emotional tone, like Donny's funeral in The\\r\\n  Big Lebowski.\", 'In my 2013 review of The Big Lebowski', \"This is a smaller influence, but Myrus's subplot in particular was\\r\\ninspired by the John le Carré (RIP) novel The Tailor of\\r\\nPanama. I'm probably not remembering this right, but the\\r\\nbit I remember is someone tells a little bitty lie that spirals out of\\r\\ncontrol and ends in death and disaster. The upside for Myrus is he\\r\\nnever finds out about the consequences of his (totally justified IMO)\\r\\nlie.\", 'So, all these characters who can\\'t see the consequences of their actions, where did\\r\\n  they come from? Going back to \"Four Kinds of Cargo\", the Sour\\r\\n  Candy crew were all structured around the Chief, who\\'s a huge\\r\\n  weirdo. Kol was the one who managed the relationship between her\\r\\n  adventure-story fantasies and reality; and Arun and Yip-Goru\\r\\n  were... pretty similar to each other. In the novel I differentiated\\r\\n  them by making Yip-Goru extremely cowardly (inspired by thons line\\r\\n  \"Why should we risk our vocalizers for a dead body?\") and Arun\\r\\n  smoothly British (inspired by his willingness to do a \"Bertie\\r\\n  Wooster routine\").', 'Becky Twice is the starting point for all the new characters. Becky\\r\\nherself stems from a request of my friend Mirabai, a big fan\\r\\nof Constellation Games who wanted to read a space opera romance\\r\\nbetween two butch women. I had one butch woman character (the Chief)\\r\\nso I created another (Becky) and put them on a collision course to\\r\\ndisastrous romance.', 'I didn\\'t consciously know this at the time, but a romance story\\r\\noften has a red-herring partner to create tension or to contrast with\\r\\nthe story\\'s \"real\" relationship. Hiroko Ingridsdotter came out of that story\\r\\nneed—a maximally inappropriate match for Becky. Hiroko\\'s\\r\\npersonality was somewhat flexible through the drafts, as she got moved\\r\\nfrom one subplot to another, but her character design has always been\\r\\n(Mirabai\\'s phrasing) \"high-maintenance military hard femme.\"', \"(Mirabai fan-service also explains Crinoline White,\\r\\nthough I cut Crinoline's storyline in the final draft. I'll talk more\\r\\nabout her in a later post, but she was basically Hiroko's style\\r\\nplus the Chief's cavalier attitude.)\", 'A chain of logic gives us the other characters: at the end of \"Four\\r\\nKinds of Cargo\", Kol suggests Sour Candy \"sit out the war in a\\r\\nforest.\" In Situation Normal we see he had a specific forest in\\r\\nmind—Cedar Commons, a whole forest planet where he and the Chief\\r\\nhad previously hidden their purloined Evidence.', 'This raises the question of why Becky is also on that forest\\r\\n  planet, or why a \"forest planet\" even exists. A lot of forests on\\r\\n  Earth are monocultures that basically exist to be cut down for wood,\\r\\n  so it made sense to say Cedar Commons was that kind of forest. This\\r\\n  created a good reason for Becky and Hiroko to have a whole planet to\\r\\n  themselves (they\\'re guarding the trees), and for Becky to have missed out on recent developments (meaning she needs\\r\\n  the same exposition you do).', \"Given that a forest planet is our chessboard, who else would\\r\\ngo there? Answer: people who want to cut down the forest and make\\r\\nthings out of the wood. Jaketown came out of this, and Myrus\\r\\nand Den, the apprentice woodworkers. From that came the\\r\\nquestion: how come Becky and Hiroko didn't hear that a customer was on\\r\\nthe way? Answer: Jaketown is running from something. Not in a\\r\\npanicky way, where you'd hide on the closest planet. Jaketown\\r\\nis a bunch of draft dodgers, and they're looking for a forest\\r\\nplanet, where they can pretend they're doing business as\\r\\nusual. Churryhoof and Dwap-Jac-Dac came out of the need to have\\r\\nsomeone chasing down the draft dodgers.\", 'At that point I had plenty of characters for a novel, with main\\r\\ncharacters from all three Outreach species, so I stopped sending\\r\\npeople to Cedar Commons.

The plot only works because one character is a huge jerk at several crucial points—IMO something to avoid in plots. Can\\'t say much else against it. Not a top-tier Wilder film, but a very good mid-1960s film. In fact I think this could work really well as a dark-and-gritty film reboot of The Dick Van Dyke Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'re big fans of star Ray Walston, a.k.a. Boothby—check him out in This \"Murder, She Wrote\" episode where he basically reprises his \"buddy boy\" role from The Apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIrma La Douce (1963): Knowing that this was supposed to be a musical explains a lot of its problems: it\\'s way too long (which would have been okay if it had had 45 minutes of musical numbers), plot develops too slowly (because people can\\'t just do a song to explain their situation), and there are weird setups that are never repaid involving people losing clothes and immediately getting them back (maybe these were hooks for songs?).\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to IMDB this made a lot of money, but there\\'s some other 1960s movie that\\'s way better on any given axis: Billy Wilder directing Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine (The Apartment), Jack Lemmon funny-voice dual role (The Great Race) Billy Wilder sex-worker farce (Kiss Me, Stupid), Shirley MacLaine sex-worker farce (Sweet Charity). On a creative level Wilder should have just tried to direct this as a musical. If it succeeds, it\\'s another feather in his cap. If it\\'s a flop, at least he went down swinging.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will admit that this film has some really funny bits, but they\\'re lost in the 2:27 run time like bacon bits in a huge salad. It\\'s also got a jaw-dropping final shot, but it\\'s mainly jaw-dropping because it\\'s tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie and, as far as I know, with every other film Billy Wilder made. Even The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes didn\\'t try anything like that.\\r\\n\\nI still love Wilder, but as I see more of his stuff I think my impression of him has been distorted by the 1959-1961 seasons, where he directed three of the best movies ever made in three consecutive at-bats.

By mutual agreement, we\\'ve been focusing on the 1980s, especially pop and new wave music. It\\'s amazing how accessible most of this stuff is these days; we\\'ve basically been going through the Billboard charts and almost all of it is on Youtube, gated only by geolocation gates and stupid commercials. (We did get some \"not available in your country\" for some of the British videos, so presumably mutatis mutandis elsewhere.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some of our favorites from the past few months, in an easy-to-click list format. Share your favorites in the comments!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nI believe this tradition started with Sumana showing me the 2001 Spike Jonze video for Fatboy Slim\\'s \"Weapon of Choice\". If you like this (and why wouldn\\'t you), I\\'ve found an officially-posted clip of Christopher Walken\\'s striptease from Pennies from Heaven (1981), twenty years before Weapon of Choice. I think there\\'s a straight line between these two videos.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sledgehammer\" by Peter Gabriel, a video I\\'d heard of through MST3K references but... wow, it\\'s amazing. Pretty much every Peter Gabriel video is inventive and fun, but the other really great one has to be \"Big Time\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\"King of Wishful Thinking\" by Go West, another great example of the \"put everything in there\" school of music video making. I also want to point out that these guys are surprisingly buff for pop musicians, who judging from other videos tend to be on the scrawny side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cars have a number of wacky videos, including \"You Might Think\" and the John Waters-directed sci-fi comedy \"You Are The Girl\", the video which proves that Ric Ocasek should have played a Vorta on DS9 alongside Iggy Pop.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuey Lewis and the News do a lot of fun rom-com music videos like \"Stuck With You\", but also things like the drumstick POV shots of \"Hip to be Square\" and the 2020 frontline-workers tribute \"I Am There For You\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHall and Oates are a group I never really heard songs from or thought about, but \"Possession Obsession\" and \"Method of Modern Love\" are both really fun, and they have a number of other good songs that I\\'m not mentioning because they don\\'t have great videos.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You Can Call Me Al\" by Paul Simon, feat. Chevy Chase. My mom used to say that when she was single and living in LA in the 1970s, one of her friends had tried to set her up with Paul Simon. Assuming this actually happened (never a safe bet with my mother\\'s stories), it would have been after his 1975 divorce. Simon went on to have relationships with Shelly Duval and Carrie Fisher, and Frances Whitney in 1975 would have fit that type, so who knows?\\r\\n\\r\\nLionel Richie\\'s glorious \"Dancing on the Ceiling\", which ends with a gratuitious \\'80s camero and led me to another great song I\\'d never heard before, \"Nightshift\" by Richie\\'s former band The Commodores. The video for \"Nightshift\" isn\\'t terribly memorable, so here\\'s Richie\\'s Technicolor West Side Story-esque video for \"All Night Long\". At the end of the video someone goes \"through\" a door and has to just stay behind the door, because it doesn\\'t really lead anywhere and the door won\\'t close! The music video equivalent of just singing softer and softer rather than fading out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough this process we discovered British band ABC, who I only knew from \"When Smokey Sings\". They have a bunch of playful videos including \"The Night You Murdered Love\", in which the lead singer is hunted by a female assassin on a skateboard; and \"Poison Arrow\", in which the lead singer is hunted by a female assassin without a skateboard. They also made a fun animated video for \"How To Be A Millionaire\" which has a cool Batman: The Animated Series feel, but the only copy I could find on Youtube plays the video in reverse, presumably to avoid the eye of Content ID.

But I\\'ve also made a lot of progress going through my backlog of books. I thought I\\'d give mention a few of these highlights.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nThe Centauri Device (M. John Harrison, 1974): Reading this book was like discovering an uncle I didn\\'t know I had. This is the origin of modern space opera, clearly a huge influence on Banks and (this is more of a guess) even Hitchhiker\\'s Guide, and it\\'s done as a takedown by someone who clearly thinks the whole thing is ridiculous. Spaceships with goofy names, meaningless space battles... The fact that it\\'s incredibly depressing didn\\'t bother me, because the author isn\\'t taking it seriously so why should I?\\r\\n\\r\\nPinpoint: How GPS is Changing Technology, Culture, and Our  Minds (Greg Milner, 2016): Interesting history on the same level of technical detail as Milner\\'s phenomenal Perfecting Sound Forever. Plenty of good military-industrial-complex gossip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings A Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About (Donald Knuth, 2001): A gift from a friend that got lost behind my bookshelf and stayed there for years. This was really nice to read, maybe because I\\'m not religious at all. I love Knuth\\'s 3:16 project and it\\'s great to hear him go into detail about his process and what he learned about the Bible while working on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dream About Lightning Bugs: A Life of Music and Cheap Lessons (Ben Folds, 2019): My favorite kind of celebrity autobiography is where they just tell you a bunch of stories about their life. The best book in this genre will probably always be Peter Falk\\'s Just One More Thing, but this one\\'s pretty good. Feel free to suggest your favorites; always looking for more of these!\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpire of Imagination: Gary Gygax and the Birth of Dungeons and Dragons (Michael Witwer, 2015): On the other hand, the lack of original research makes this biography read like a Wikipedia article, and there\\'s also fictionalized dramatizations, like you\\'d get in a biopic. Two types of biography I find much less enjoyable than \"celebrity tells stories\", and furthermore two that pull the book in incompatible directions. However the subject matter is really interesting. I admit I was pulled in by the incredible cover art, something that basically never happens to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian Spring (Norman Spinrad, 1991): An entertaining near-future sci-fi story that extends the Cold War into the 21st century, undone by one fatal error: it refers to UCLA as the home of the Trojans. The correct answer is, the Bruins. [taps note cards] The Bruins.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollision Course (Barrington Bayley, 1974): A brilliant concept (Earth as the focus of two timelines going in opposite directions) and a creepy setting can\\'t make up for a cheesy plot. Mentioning this one solely for the, again, brilliant concept, and the alien with the mind-bending pronouns.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot quite done with A Suitable Boy (Vikram Seth, 1993), but I\\'m nearing the end and I don\\'t think the last 150 pages are going to change my mind: this is a really, really fun book. Ever since I\\'ve known Sumana this has been one of her favorites, and it\\'s good to be able to get her references. I\\'ve been moseying through it over the past... couple of years... but recently picked up the pace because once I finish it we can watch the BBC miniseries that just came out. Yes, they made a whole miniseries while I was reading the book. PS to Seth: you can finish A Suitable Girl! We believe in you!\\r\\n\\r\\n ', ' Sun Nov 01 2020 16:08 October Film Roundup: \\n   Here we go! Take a break from your doomscrolling with some fun filmroundupscrolling. Remember, if you don\\'t read the words, your scrolling has all been for naught.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nStranger Than Fiction (2006): Thought the twist of this rom-com was going to be the fictional character falling in love with his  neurotic creator, but that twist would be too creepy for this sweet story full of Will Farrell goofiness. A good time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSumana and I both liked the office set for Dustin Hoffman\\'s literature-professor character. All that 1970s concrete and glass made me think of the offices at Cal State Bakersfield where I\\'d end up babysitting myself while my mom was getting her masters\\' degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout implying that it affected my enjoyment of the movie, I want to mention that Karen Eiffel\\'s novels seem pretty bad. There\\'s always a reverse-Ishtar problem when one tries to depict great art using ordinary skill. Stranger than Fiction falls flat depicting both the novels themselves and the way critics think about fiction (as opposed to, say, screenplays).\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes Sumana and I play a game where we figure out how early in human history a given story could have been set. We couldn\\'t come up with any \"fictional character comes to life\" stories (as opposed to, like, \"statue comes to life\") older than the twentieth century, but I\\'d think it could have happened in medieval Japan, or in Europe any time after Tristam Shandy. However this particular setup seems best suited to the early 1960s—a mediocre highbrow writer who hasn\\'t finished a book in ten years but is kept on contract with a big publisher for prestige. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lady Eve (1941): I kind of thought I\\'d seen this one, but it turns out All About Eve (1950) merely has a misleading title. This was another fun rom-com, though made much earlier, at a time when Hollywood was still trying to figure out how to merge the \"rom\" with the \"com\". Barbara Stanwyck is always hilarious as the brassy dame who don\\'t need no man, but once the man she don\\'t need enters the picture it always loses a little. At least now they\\'re pairing her with A-list hunks like Henry Fonda instead of that guy from Christmas in Connecticut.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe speculated that the classic A New Leaf (1973) might have started as a gender-swap of Fonda\\'s ditzy rich scientist and Stanwyck\\'s gold-digging schemer. Think about it!\\r\\n\\r\\nBetaville (1986): The Alphaville parody/sequel you didn\\'t know you needed. Godard paid tribute to American genre fiction, and America responded with a no-budget short full of great gags that you can watch on Youtube. Big recommendation. Watching black-and-white French New Wave people wander around 1986 New York was a soothing balm for this guy who hasn\\'t been in Manhattan for months.\\r\\n\\nIn Television Spotlight news, we re-upped our CBS All Access account for the new Discovery season, and caught up with the first season of Lower Decks. We were initially very skeptical of the main character—a little \"competent asshole\" goes a long long way in this household—but the other characters are quite fun, and by the end we were on board and excited for season 2... which is about average for the first season of a Trek show. We loved the continuity deep cuts. My absolute favorite part was how the inhabitants of Beta III went right back to worshipping Landru the minute the Enterprise left and the Federation never followed up.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW, this is by no means a novel complaint, but the near-total (but not total!) lack of NCOs and enlisted beings in Starfleet really makes things weird for Lower Decks. All the schmoes and screwups in this show are Starfleet Academy graduates. Theoretically, any one of them could give orders to Chief O\\'Brien. But there aren\\'t any O\\'Briens around to do the grunt work. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an explanation for the officer-heaviness of Starfleet vessels, which I learned in the \"Is Starfleet Military?\" episode of the Gimme That Star Trek podcast: it mirrors the structure of a bomber crew like the one Gene Roddenberry served in during WWII. It was great to learn an explanation for this, but when writing Situation Normal I tried to make things a little more realistic.

That\\'s because the \"July\" Roundup had a lot of overlap with August, and then instead of movies we spent the rest of August watching Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005-2008), a really nice kids\\' show that paved the way for more sophisticated shows like Steven Universe, not to mention its own sequel, The Legend of Korra, which we saw in 2015 and are now rewatching. Time has lost its meaning and there might not be much to show next month, is what I\\'m saying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nThe Old Guard (2020): Nothing fancy, but a enjoyable action concept leads to a lot of scenes in the Deadpool mold where the heroes can soak up incredible amounts of damage and keep fighting. A conceit similar to the heavy use of tasers in PG-13 movies (and Korra) in that it lets you have more brutality than an audience would otherwise be comfortable with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rise and Fall of Nokia (2017): Smana wanted to watch this documentary because she was involved in Nokia\\'s mobile-Linux projects of the early 2010s. I enjoyed the parts of the documentary that dealt with the invention of cell phones but I thought it presented the introduction of the iPhone as a fait accompli rather than going into why Nokia\\'s (kinda disorganized) response was inadequate. Not the tone you want to take in a film made to celebrate the centenary of Finland\\'s independence, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nNixon in China (2011): We streamed the Metropolitan Opera\\'s performance for free when they put it up. I really love the libretto but neither of us were wild about the music. We don\\'t really watch opera, so we don\\'t have the reading conventions down. After an Act I which was pretty naturalistic and easy to read, we were totally befuddled by the weird fourth wall breaking in Act II. Act III was not naturalistic at all, but typical of what I think of as opera: people singing out their emotions, you know, like a Broadway musical.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I keep going back to Act II, which features the Nixons watching another opera (The Red Detachment of Women). Their reactions to the plot lead them to interfere with the performance, but the opera-within-an-opera seems designed to accommodate and work with such audience interference, because of course it\\'s all part of one big opera and the \"audience\" is just as much performers as the people they\\'re interfering with. That was really interesting but I imagine that\\'s a feature of Act II of Nixon in China and not something special you get from the art form of opera.\\r\\n\\r\\n ', 'But I keep going back to Act II, which features the Nixons watching another opera (The Red Detachment of Women).
